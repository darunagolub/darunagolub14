            <h3>Early history</h3>
            <p>
                Pixar got its start in 1974 when New York Institute of Technology's founder, Alexander Schure, who was also the owner of a traditional animation studio, established the Computer Graphics Lab and recruited computer scientists who shared his ambitions about creating the world's first computer-animated film.
            </p>

            <p>   
                In 1982, the team began working on special-effects film sequences with Industrial Light & Magic. After years of research, and key milestones such as the Genesis Effect in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and the Stained Glass Knight in Young Sherlock Holmes, the group, which then numbered 40 individuals, was spun out as a corporation in February 1986 by Catmull and Smith. Among the 38 remaining employees, there were also Malcolm Blanchard, David DiFrancesco, Ralph Guggenheim, and Bill Reeves, who had been part of the team since the days of NYIT.

           <h3>Adaptation to television</h3>
           <p>
            Toy Story is the first Pixar film to be adapted for television as Buzz Lightyear of Star Command film and TV series on the UPN television network. Cars became the second with the help of Cars Toons, a series of 3-to-5-minute short films running between regular Disney Channel show intervals and featuring Mater. Between 2013 and 2014, Pixar released its first two television specials, Toy Story of Terror and Toy Story That Time Forgot. Monsters at Work, a television series spin-off of Monsters, Inc., is currently in development for Disney+.
           </p>
           <p>
            On December 10, 2020, it was announced that three series would be released on Disney+ sometime in the next few years. The first is Dug Days where Dug explores the suburbia. Next, an untitled Cars show was announced to hit Disney+ in Fall 2022 where viewers will follow Mater and Lighting McQueen as they go on a road trip. Lastly, an original show entitled Win or Lose would be released on Disney+ in Fall 2023.
